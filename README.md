* This week mainly focus on YOLO for object detection
* You can download pretrained YOLO weights from [BaiduDrive](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1nu7AAbn)
This repository does not contain weights and model_data files which can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X79ZtIBp-Q70THZapcTeLqffxIqbLx_I/view?usp=sharing.
The example of detecting and creating bounding box around the object is shown in the object_localisation.ipynb notebook.
